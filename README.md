Getting and Cleaning Data - Week 4 Final Project
This file contians the project codebook, the R script (run_analysis.R), and the 
final tidied data outcome (second_tidy.txt). 

Files
a) Codebook.md
- This markdown file describes how to use these files, how to understand the 
data, and what data transformations were undertaken to tidy the data.
b) run_analysis.R
- This R script contains the code to perform the following data tidying:
-- 1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
-- 2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for 
each measurement. 
-- 3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
-- 4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
-- 5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set 
with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
c) second_tidy.txt
- This file contains the output of the final data transformation.
